Scribble is built and maintained by [@jujuadams](https://twitter.com/jujuadams) who has a long history of fiddling with text engines. Juju's worked on a lot of [commercial GameMaker games](http://www.jujuadams.com/).

Many, many other people have contributed bug reports and feature requests over the years, too many to list here. Scribble wouldn't exist without them and Juju is eternally grateful for their creativity and patience.

Scribble will never truly be finished because contributions and suggestions from new users are always welcome. Scribble wouldn't be the same without [your](https://tenor.com/search/whos-awesome-gifs) input! Make a suggestion on the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/issues) if you'd like a feature to be added.
