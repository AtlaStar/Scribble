Backwards port of Scribble to GMS1, because @DragoniteSpam doesn't have anything better to do

Original readme:

<h1 align="center">Scribble 3.2.3</h1>

### @jujuadams

Vertex buffer-based text engine. Faster and more comprehensive than GameMaker native rendering. Shader-based processing allows for efficient and flexible dynamic effects without lots of draw_text() calls.

With thanks to glitchroy and Rob van Saaze for additional testing.
