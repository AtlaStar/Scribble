# Text Formatting

&nbsp;

Scribble supports many in-line commands that can be used inside a string. Here's a quick example:

```
scribble("This text is normal size. [scale,2]This text is twice as big.").draw(x, y);
```

This will draw a string with two differently sized substrings. Simple!

Of course, because the `[` character is used to open a command tag, putting a single square bracket in a line will cause Scribble to try to interpret following characters as part of a command tag. If you want to include a `[` literal in your string then double up the character:

```
//This string will display as "Here's a square bracket [!"
scribble("Here's a square bracket [[!");
```

You **don't** need to double up the closing bracket `]` to include one in your displayed text.

&nbsp;

**Please note** that text alignment follows the following rules:

1. In-line vertical alignment affects the entire textbox and cannot be changed midway through text display
2. Changing horizontal alignment in the middle of a line of text will add a line break
3. Native GameMaker font alignment options (`fa_left`, `fa_center`, `fa_right`) are not intended to be used in conjunction with Scribble's own custom alignment options (`pin_left`, `pin_center`, `pin_right`)

|`[nbsp]`                             |Inserts a non-breaking space. Actual non-breaking space characters *are* natively supported but `[nbsp]` may be more convenient in some situations                                                                              |
|`[zwsp]`                             |Inserts a zero-width space. Actual zero-width space characters *are* natively supported but `[zwsp]` may be more convenient in some situations                                                                                  |
