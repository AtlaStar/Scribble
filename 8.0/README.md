## Features

Scribble is a comprehensive text rendering library designed to replace GameMaker's native [`draw_text()` functions](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/source/_build/3_scripting/4_gml_reference/drawing/text/) without adding unnecessary complexity. Scribble's design should feel familiar and intuitive for GameMaker users.

There are a multitude of very useful features available:
- In-line colour and font swapping
- In-line sprites, including animation
- Text wrapping (including CJK-compatible wrapping)
- Typewriter
- Events, such as triggering sound effects and screenshake directly from typewriter text
- Automatic [pagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination)
- High performance caching
- Font effect baking
- Resolution-independent [MSDF fonts](msdf-fonts)

Scribble will never truly be finished because contributions and suggestions from new users are always welcome.
