<h1 align="center">Scribble 02.03.02 (lite)</h1>

### @jujuadams

Vertex buffer-based text engine. Faster and more comprehensive than GameMaker native rendering. Shader-based processing allows for efficient and flexible dynamic effects without lots of draw_text() calls.

The "lite" version of Scribble removes Events and Hyperlinks.
