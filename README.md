<h1 align="center">Scribble 4.7.3</h1>

### @jujuadams

Vertex buffer-based text engine. Faster and more comprehensive than GameMaker native rendering. Shader-based processing allows for efficient and flexible dynamic effects without lots of draw_text() calls.

With thanks to glitchroy, Mark Turner, DragoniteSpam, sp202, and Rob van Saaze for testing.

**How do I import Scribble into my game?**

GameMaker Studio 2.2.3 allows you to import assets (including scripts and shaders) directly into your project via the "Local Package" system. From the [Releases](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/releases) tab, download a .yymp file (I suggest starting with the newest version!). In the GameMaker IDE, load up your project and click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu then import all scripts and shaders from the Scribble package. Now you're all set up!
