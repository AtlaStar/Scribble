## Features

Scribble is a comprehensive text rendering library designed to replace GameMaker's native [`draw_text()` functions](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Text/Text.htm) without adding unnecessary complexity. Scribble's design should feel familiar and intuitive for GameMaker users.

There are a multitude of very useful features available:
- In-line text formatting
- In-line sprites
- Text wrapping (including CJK-compatible wrapping)
- Typewriter (per-character and per-line)
- In-line script execution
- Automatic [pagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination)
- High performance caching
- Font effect baking

## About & Support

Scribble is supported for all GameMaker export modules, including consoles, with the exception that **HTML5 is not supported** due to [bugs in GameMaker's JavaScript runner](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/issues/18). If you'd like to report a bug or suggest a feature, please use the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/issues). Scribble is constantly being maintained and upgraded; bugs are usually addressed within a few days of being reported.

Scribble is built and maintained by [@jujuadams](https://twitter.com/jujuadams) who has a long history of fiddling with text engines. Juju's worked on a lot of [commercial GameMaker games](http://www.jujuadams.com/); Scribble is the product of practical experience dealing with console porting and localisation.

Many people have contributed to Scribble's development. They've reported bugs, provided feedback, and suggested features. Juju would like to thank glitchroy, Mark Turner, DragoniteSpam, sp202, Rob van Saaze, soVes, and @stoozey_ for their support.

Scribble will never truly be finished because contributions and suggestions from new users are always welcome. Scribble wouldn't be the same without [your](https://tenor.com/search/whos-awesome-gifs) input! Make a suggestion on the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/issues) if you'd like a feature to be added.
